============

A spinner-HUD component to notify a user that the app is blocked/working.

A modal web component that contains a CSS spinner and a label. Style 'x-status-hud' as you would any other vanilla HTML element. To learn how it was made, go read this article.
 
x-status-hud was inspired by [x-spinner](https://github.com/x-tag/spinner). This is kind of like x-spinner-lite as it was built for a tutorial on creating X-Tags that Angelina wanted to be beginner-friendly.
